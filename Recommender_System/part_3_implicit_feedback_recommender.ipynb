        "What is implicit feedback, exactly? Let's revisit collaborative filtering. In Part 1, we learned that [collaborative filtering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Collaborative_filtering) is based on the assumption that `similar users like similar things`. The user-item matrix, or \"utility matrix\", is the foundation of collaborative filtering. In the utility matrix, rows represent users and columns represent items.\n",

        "\n",
        "The cells of the matrix are populated by a given user's degree of preference towards an item, which can come in the form of:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **explicit feedback:** direct feedback towards an item (e.g., movie ratings which we explored in Part 1\n",
        "2. **implicit feedback:** indirect behaviour towards an item (e.g., purchase history, browsing history, search behaviour)\n",
        "\n",
        "Implicit feedback makes assumptions about a user's preference based on their actions towards items. Let's take Netflix for example. If you binge-watch a show and blaze through all seasons in a week, there's a high chance that you like that show. However, if you start watching a series and stop halfway through the first episode, there's suspicion to believe that you probably don't like that show.\n"

        "The [implicit](https://github.com/benfred/implicit) package is built around a linear algebra technique called [matrix factorization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_factorization_(recommender_systems)), which can help us discover latent features underlying the interactions between users and movies. These latent features give a more compact representation of user tastes and item descriptions. Matrix factorization is particularly useful for very sparse data and can enhance the quality of recommendations. The algorithm works by factorizing the original user-item matrix into two factor matrices:\n",
        "\n",
        "- user-factor matrix (n_users, k)\n",
        "- item-factor matrix (k, n_items)\n",
        "\n",
        "We are reducing the dimensions of our original matrix into \"taste\" dimensions. We cannot interpret what each latent feature $k$ represents. However, we could imagine that one latent feature may represent users who like romantic comedies from the 1990s, while another latent feature may represent movies which are independent foreign language films.\n",

        "<img src=\"images/matrix-factorization.png\" width=\"60%\"/>\n",
        "\n",
        "In traditional matrix factorization, such as SVD, we would attempt to solve the factorization at once which can be very computationally expensive. As a more practical alternative, we can use a technique called `Alternating Least Squares (ALS)` instead. With ALS, we solve for one factor matrix at a time:\n",
        "\n",
        "- Step 1: hold user-factor matrix fixed and solve for the item-factor matrix\n",
        "- Step 2: hold item-factor matrix fixed and solve for the user-item matrix\n",

        "We alternate between Step 1 and 2 above, until the dot product of the item-factor matrix and user-item matrix is approximately equal to the original X (user-item) matrix. This approach is less computationally expensive and can be run in parallel.\n",
