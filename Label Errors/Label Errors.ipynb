    "In this dataset, 20% of the grade labels are actually incorrect (the `noisy_letter_grade` column). Synthetic noise was added to this dataset for the purpose of this lab. In this lab, we have access to the true letter grade each student should have received (the `letter_grade` column), which we use for evaluating both the underlying accuracy of model predictions and how well our approach detects which data are mislabeled. We are careful to only use these true grades for evaluation, not for model training.\n",

    "_Advanced topic_: you might notice that the above `cl_issue_idx` differs in length (by a little bit) from our `issue_idx`. The reason for this is that we implemented a slightly simplified version of the algorithm in this lab. We skipped a calibration step after computing the confident joint that makes the confident joint have the true noisy prior $p(labels)$ (summed over columns for each row) and also add up to the total number of examples. If you're interested in the details of this, see equation 3 and the subsequent explanation in the [paper](https://jair.org/index.php/jair/article/view/12125)."
